							<h3>Panache</h3>
							<p><em>“Scholar and kings are never compared. Kings are worshipped in their country, but scholars are worshipped everywhere.”</em></p>
							<p>So, you consider yourself to be a scholar. You know a LOT about a LOT of things? You think you can crack anything and everything put forth before you from the vast, never ending ocean of general knowledge? You consider yourself to be a Quizzing Wizard?</p>
							<p>If your answer to the above questions is YES, Panache is the perfect platform for you to participate. If the answer is NO, just come casually. You will come with a “YES”, the next season.</p>
							<p>Panache is a quiz which will test your general knowledge based on anything and everything under the sun. All you need is comprehensive knowledge and an impeccable presence of mind to crack this nut. So if you are a college student with a quest for knowledge, you HAVE TO be there. And irrespective of your winning or not, PANACHE is <i>akshaypatra</i>, from which endless <i>amrit</i>of knowledge flows out.</p>

							<h3>SPAVe</h3>
							<p>S-PAVe i.e. the Student Professional Awareness Venture - is a student’s first look into the professional world of management, business, and estimates. Guess estimates and case studies require no more than aptitude, logic, and out of the box thinking. It’s something everyone’s capable of doing but only a few are successful at. If you’ve chosen to take the “non-tech road” or just simply want a break from all the technical/engineering “stuff” and rattle your brain you’d want to try your hand at current-X and (S)PAVe your way to success.</p>

							<h3>Junkyard</h3>
							<p>The true essence of being an engineer is the ability to be ‘The Creator’. An engineer can convert what a layman would call trash, into treasure.</p><p>Using the provided materials, the participant is expected to make a value added commodity that may have some practical use. Limited resources, limited time and a problem to solve. That’s what ‘Junkyard’ is all about. All that you need to do, is some “Juggad from Kabbad”. Put on your hats of creativity, get ready to dirty your hands, bring out the genius within and look hard before you decide to discard the diamond in the rock. Let the Battle of Trash begin!</p>
